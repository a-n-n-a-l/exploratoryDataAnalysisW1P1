# Exploratory Data Analysis - Week 1 - Project 1
This repository contains 4 R files and 4 png files
<p>
Each file gets the the "Individual household electric power consumption Data Set" data from from the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/">UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository</a>, cleans it up a little and plots graphs to comply with the requests in the Coursera's Exploratory Data Analsysis course in week 1, project 1.
<p><b>plot1.R</b> - creates a histogram of Global Active Power and saves it to the file <b>plot1.png</b> </p>
<p><b>plot2.R</b> - graphs Global Active Power in relation to the date/time and saves it to the file <b>plot2.png</b></p> 
<p><b>plot3.R</b> - graphs the Energy Sub Metering in relation to the date/time and saves it to the file <b>plot3.png</b> </p>
<p><b>plot4.R</b> - combines the graphs from plot 2 and plot 3 and adds 2 more graphs that show the relationship of Voltage in relation to the date/time and Global Reactive Power in relation to the date/time and saves it to one image contained in the file <b>plot4.png</b> </p>
